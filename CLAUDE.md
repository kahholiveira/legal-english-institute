## Project Overview

This is a web project for the Legal English Institute, structured as a static website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Development Commands

Since the project files are currently empty, standard web development commands would likely include:

- **Serve locally**: Use a local web server like `python -m http.server` or `npx serve`
- **Package management**: `npm install` to install dependencies (when package.json is populated)

## Architecture Notes

- This appears to be a static website project for educational content
- Main entry point will likely be in the `index/` directory
- JavaScript functionality will be in `js/script.js`
- Styling managed through `style.css` and potentially additional files in `styles/`
- Static assets organized in the `assets/` directory

## Getting Started

The project structure suggests this is a frontend-only educational website. When populated with content, it will likely serve legal English learning materials and resources.

## File Organization

- Keep HTML files organized by section/topic
- Place all static assets in the `assets/` directory
- Use the `docs/` directory for project documentation
- Maintain consistent naming conventions for educational content files
